# Spell Checker
### A Spell Checker using Edit Distance

The checker uses two functions edit1 and edit2 to create words that have an edit distance of 1 and 2 respectively from the given
word using deletion, insertion, replacement and transposition. The known function restricts the created words to the words that 
are in the dictionary.

## Evaluation
75% accuracy is achieved on a test set created from [Roger Mitton's Birkbeck spelling error corpus](http://ota.ox.ac.uk/headers/0643.xml).
